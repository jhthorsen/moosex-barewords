NAME
    MooseX::Barewords - Turn barewords into attr/arg getters

DESCRIPTION
    This module has modified code from subs::auto.

SYNOPSIS
     package Foo;

     use MooseX::Barewords;

     has foo => ( is => 'ro' );

     sub my_method {
        print self->foo; # this will always return the attribute value
        print foo;       # will print whatever $self->foo holds
                         # unless 'foo' is set in argument list
     }

     sub add {
        print a + b;
     }

     # this will make 'foo' bareword return 42 instead of
     # what $self->foo holds.
     $self->my_method(foo => 42); 

     # will print 43
     $self->add(a => 42, b => 1);

FUNCTIONS
  self
     $self = self;

    Returns the current object in caller method.

  has
     has $name => %args;

    Same as Moose::has(), but with some extra sugar to make barewords work
    as expected.

    Accessor will be prefixed with "__", but can still be accessed by $name:

     $acc = "__$name";
     $self->$name eq $self->$acc; # true

  init_meta
     $class->init_meta(%options);

    Called on "import()". Will set up Variable::Magic on caller package and
    turn all barewords into subs.

INTERNAL FUNCTIONS
  get_attr
     $value = get_attr($name, @args);

    Will return either the argument or attribute valued named $name, or
    confess if no such arg/attr exists.

    Arguments will be prioritized over attributes names.

  get_arg
     $value = get_arg($name, $level);

    Will return the argument named $name or confess if no such argument
    exists in caller method.

  init_wizard
     $wiz = init_wizard();

    Will return a Variable::Magic wizard, used on caller package.

  corelist_map
     %corelist = corelist_map();

    Returns a hash, where the keys are the names of the core functions.
